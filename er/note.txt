*challenges
1. there was an exception that required a package called graphviz when I ran the command:

$ python manage.py graph_models admin_app auth -o admin_app_model_er.png

> fixed it by installing the actual binary of the graphciz program using:

$ brew install graphviz

before the er generation worked
